# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A game of Rock, Paper, Scissors made with Python

The project of creating the Rock, Paper, Scissors game encompasses various key elements. It uses both public and private variables to manage essential data, including player and computer options, and determines the game's winner. Class and instance variables are employed to control option choices and store relevant information. Additionally, class and instance methods are implemented, including input validation and graphical display of game statistics. Inheritance is used to relate the Game, Player, and Computer classes, all derived from the Template class. Method overloading is also applied to provide different responses based on input type, and method overriding is done to customize the functionality of getOption. In summary, this program allows users to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, then pits their choices against a random computer decision, determines the winner according to game rules, and presents statistics on the most popular choices.
